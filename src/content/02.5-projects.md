#### [Kraaven/WandGameVR](https://github.com/Kraaven/WandGameVR)

WandGameVR is a personal project exploring innovative user interaction in virtual reality. The project focuses on enabling input through hand-drawn gestures in the air, creating a unique and intuitive interaction mechanism.

###### Key Highlights:

##### Algorithm Implementation:
- The core of this project is an implementation of the Procrustes Analysis algorithm, allowing precise gesture recognition and comparison.

##### Built from Scratch:
- All the code was developed entirely from scratch, demonstrating a deep understanding of VR development. (The 3D models used are CC0-licensed.)

##### Dynamic Gesture Loading:
- Gestures are loaded at runtime through JSON data deserialization. This means new gestures can be created and added dynamically during any session.

##### Letters or shapes are drawn multiple times (10–20 iterations).
- The average of each vertex is computed to generate a "perfect" human-drawn shape for accurate gesture recognition.
##### Documentation:
- A semi-formal report was created to document the project and its methodology. You can read it here.

###### Applications

Application of Procrustes Analysis in Gameplay
The algorithm was applied to design unique VR game mechanics.

Beyond Games: Expanding Use Cases
To showcase the potential of this gesture recognition system beyond gaming, an additional application was developed:

This feature demonstrates how air-drawn gestures can be utilized in non-gaming contexts, paving the way for innovative use cases in VR interfaces.
