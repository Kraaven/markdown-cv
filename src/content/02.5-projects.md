### WandGameVR
#### [Kraaven/WandGameVR](https://github.com/Kraaven/WandGameVR)

I wanted to explore different forms of user interaction in VR. I developed this project as a mode of user input via hand gestures made in the air.

- This Project implements an algorithm called **Procusted Analysis**
- I built this entire project, and the code, completely from **scratch** (3D models are CC0)
- Gestures are loaded during runtime via Json data deserialization. Which means new shapes can be created and loaded during any session. The Letters used for comparision are drawn about 10-20 times, and the average of each vertex is taken, creating the "Perfect" human drawn shape
- I wrote a semi formal report for this personal project. It can be found [here](https://github.com/Kraaven/WandGameVR/blob/main/report.pdf)
