## Projects

This section highlights a selection of my personal projects, showcasing my skills and passion for development. While not all of my work is hosted here, I’ve handpicked these projects to represent some of my most interesting and impactful endeavors. Each project demonstrates my ability to solve unique challenges, explore cutting-edge technologies, and apply innovative solutions.

### WandGameVR
#### [Kraaven/WandGameVR](https://github.com/Kraaven/WandGameVR)

WandGameVR is a personal project exploring innovative user interaction in virtual reality. The project focuses on enabling input through hand-drawn gestures in the air, creating a unique and intuitive interaction mechanism.

###### Key Highlights:

##### Algorithm Implementation:
- The core of this project is an implementation of the Procrustes Analysis algorithm, allowing **precise gesture recognition** and comparison.

##### Built from Scratch:
- All the code was developed entirely from **scratch**, demonstrating a deep understanding of VR development. (The 3D models used are **CC0-licensed**.)

##### Dynamic Gesture Loading:
- Gestures are loaded at runtime through **JSON data deserialization**. This means new gestures can be created and added dynamically during any session.

##### Letters or shapes are drawn multiple times (10–20 iterations).
- The average of each vertex is computed to generate a "perfect" human-drawn shape for accurate gesture recognition.
##### Documentation:
- A **semi-formal report** was created to document the project and its methodology. You can read it [here](https://github.com/Kraaven/WandGameVR/blob/main/report.pdf).

###### Applications

Application of Procrustes Analysis in Gameplay
The algorithm was applied to design unique VR game mechanics.

Beyond Games: Expanding Use Cases
To showcase the potential of this gesture recognition system beyond gaming, an additional application was developed:

This feature demonstrates how air-drawn gestures can be utilized in non-gaming contexts, paving the way for innovative use cases in VR interfaces.


### Project Vasundhara
#### [Kraaven/ProjectVasundhara](https://github.com/Kraaven/ProjectVasundhara)

Project Vasundhara is an interactive VR application designed to gamify learning chemistry in a fun and immersive way. Players combine elements to create molecules and use them to build a dynamic virtual world, offering an engaging way to understand how chemistry shapes the environment around us.

*This project was developed in just 36 hours during the CAD 2.0 Hackathon, where it won* **1st place**

###### Key Highlights:

##### The Experience:
- Project Vasundhara is **not a game**, it’s a creative learning tool designed for short but impactful sessions. It gamifies chemistry in an entertaining yet educational way, making it ideal for ~20-minute learning experiences.

##### The Interactive Process:
- Blending **real-world chemistry with a touch of creative fiction**, the application allows players to mix atoms into recipes to create molecules using actual chemical formulas.
- Atoms are **color-coded based on textbook conventions**, helping reinforce learning as a visual aid.
- Players use these molecules to generate ORBS—unique objects that represent aspects of the natural world. For example:
    - Combine NaCl + H₂O to create the Orb of Ocean.
    - Use H₂ × 5 to form the Orb of Sun.

##### My Contributions
- Developed a **modular JSON-based recipe system** that makes it easy to define new atom and molecule combinations.
- Implemented a name-viewing system for atoms and molecules, ensuring convenience and clarity for players during gameplay.


###### The Application

### Walmart Interactive
#### [Kraaven/Walmart_Interactive](https://github.com/Kraaven/Walmart_Interactive)

Walmart Interactive was developed as part of the Walmart Sparkathon, a nationwide hackathon in India, where students were challenged to build solutions to benefit the retail industry. Our project aimed to redefine how customers interact with retail catalogs using immersive virtual reality.

###### Key Highlights:

##### The Concept and System
- Walmart Interactive allows clients with VR headsets to browse a virtual catalog of products, represented as interactive 3D models.

- Product Registration: Staff members can register product information along with an image. The image is processed using a Gaussian Splatting + Generative AI model to generate 3D models. This data is then stored in a database.

- Dashboard Integration: A user-friendly dashboard enables staff to modify product information or upload custom 3D models.

- R Client Functionality: The VR client dynamically fetches product information and 3D models from the database and displays them seamlessly at runtime.

##### My Contributions

- WebRequests and GLTF Loading: Created functionality to fetch product data and load 3D models for seamless integration into the VR environment.

- User-Friendly Interface: Designed intuitive UI elements to enhance the product-viewing experience in VR.
